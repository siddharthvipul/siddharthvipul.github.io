<h1 id="context">Context</h1>

<p>Last year I attended Flock to Fedora for the First time and it was one of the
best events I had ever been to. After attending DevConfs, FOSDEM etc, Flock is
still my favorite event to attend. Fedora 2019 was no less of an experience.</p>

<p>Flock to Fedora is an annual conference for Fedora contributors. Flock follows
the tradition to organize the event at a different location every year. This
year was no different.</p>

<h3 id="where">Where?</h3>

<p>Danubius Hotel Helia
Budapest, Hungary</p>

<h3 id="when">When?</h3>

<p><strong>August 8th</strong> to <strong>August 11th</strong></p>

<p>I had 2 main purpose to be there.
* Represent CentOS in Flock
* Support my GSoC intern while she presents her work in the Summer Coding
  Projects Showcase (Which I organised along with other brilliand folks
  involved)</p>

<h2 id="centos-presence-in-flock">CentOS presence in Flock</h2>

<p>We got a booth right beside Registeration booth and right in the hallway in
front of main room (Helia).
Hallway was a very good feature for this Flock. every room was connected to the
same hallway making the communication very easy. When I was not behind the
booth, I was speaking to amazing people, learning what they were doing or
attending some talk.</p>

<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>

<p>As usual Flock kicked off with &lsquo;The state of Fedora&rsquo; by the Fedora Project Leader <a href="#">Matthew Miller</a> The
This was again, a brilliant representation of everything happening in Fedora
world.
There was a second another very interesting keynote &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Probably fine&rsquo; by Cate Huston.
This was hilarous and totally relatable. Here is a small quote taken from her
keynote</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Engineers say they hate process. But I think engineers secretly love process. It&rsquo;s just that when it works, they call it culture</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This day, most of the time I was behind CentOS booth. I was not surprised to
see not a lot of people asking question but just discussing (since most of the people already knew
what it is). Well, this is not entirely true, one question that has been
lurking around since DevConf India was &lsquo;When is CentOS 8 releasing?&rsquo;</p>

<p>A few other talks I attended this day was
* <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &lsquo;Facebook Loves Fedora (and Chef)&rsquo; by Michel Alexandre Salim and Joseph Chilcote
Apart from other interesting facts and things, one that stood out the most was
how Fedora has overtaken Ubuntu usage in fb. Here is a photo from that
<a href="#">slide</a>
* &lsquo;Improving Packaging Experience with Automation&rsquo; by Neil and Igor
A lot of ideas on how things can be better. This, by the end, ended up in a
discussion on how to make things better in packaging world!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&lsquo;Fedora IoT: who, what, when, where, why, how?&rsquo; by Peter Robinson (nullr0ute)
All about IoT and $the_title_speaks_it_all</p></li>

<li><p>&lsquo;Slideshow karaoke&rsquo; by Adam Samalik
Props to Adam for coming to come up with interesting slides in a hurry. This
was moved 2 days early and he wasn&rsquo;t very ready with the slides.
Tom &lsquo;spot&rsquo; Callaway&rsquo;s karaoke was <em>the</em> best. Waiting for the recordings for
this one.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>

<p>The second day, Denise Dumas (VP of Platform Engineering at Red Hat) presented
the relationship of Fedora, Red Hat and our new overlord IBM. Since the
acquisition, there are a lot of talks around the community if the Fedora
Project will be affected by it. Denise was there to clear all the doubts.
A line from her slide that was impactful and reasonable to the community&rsquo;
&gt; If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</p>
