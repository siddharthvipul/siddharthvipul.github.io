          <p>We are excited to announce that the call for proposals is now open for the Distribution devroom at the upcoming FOSDEM 2021, to be hosted virtually on February 6th 2021.</p>
<p>As more and more workloads are being considered for containerization in
the future and are finally landing in virtualized environments today,
distributions remain a critical success factor and are more important
than ever. Containers, like virtual machines, are not magical and
rely on piles of software being assembled in a way that is repeatable,
reliable, and functional. This is at the very heart of the problem that
distributions have always solved.</p>
<p>Each distribution is responsible for building, testing, and releasing
software as well as managing the lifecycle of each application in the
collection. Additionally, distributions do very important work in ensuring
that various versions of upstream software work well together and can
co-exist. Distributions are also, often responsible, for &ldquo;de-vendoring&rdquo;
upstream software so that security fixes can be applied more quickly.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions targeted at contributors interested in issues
unique to distributions, especially in the following topics:</p>
<h2 id="topics-and-areas-of-focus">Topics and Areas of Focus</h2>
<h4 id="focus-areas">Focus Areas</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ways that distribution technologies can be leveraged to allow
for easier creation of a multi-verse of artifacts from single source
trees. This includes the increasing move toward self-contained
applications and providing multiple non-parallel installed versions
of software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efforts being made in shared environments around Build/Test/Release
cycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topics related to the delivery problem as it impacts updates in
terms of both size and rollback/reliability are expected to be featured.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="additional-topic-ideas">Additional Topic Ideas</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distribution and Community collaborations, eg: how does code flow from
developers to end users across communities, ensuring trust and code
audibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automating building software for redistribution to minimize human
involvement, eg: bots that branch and build software, bots that
participate as team members extending human involvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-distribution collaboration on common issues, eg: content
distribution, infrastructure, and documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growing distribution communities, eg: onboarding new users, helping
new contributors learn community values and technology,  increasing
contributor technical skills, recognizing and rewarding contribution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Principles of Rolling Releases, Long Term Supported Releases (LTS),
Feature gated releases, and calendar releases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribution construction, installation, deployment, packaging and
content management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balancing new code and active upstreams verus security updates, back
porting and minimization of user breaking changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delivering architecture independent software universally across
architectures within the confines of distribution systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effectively communicating the difference in experience across
architectures for developers, packagers, and users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with vendors and including them in the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The future of distributions, emerging trends and evolving user demands
from the idea of a platform</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideal submissions are actionable and opinionated. Submissions may
be in the form of 25 or 50 minute talks, panel sessions, round-table
discussions, or Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions.</p>
<p>Due to the virtual format of FOSDEM 2021, the preferred length for talk
submissions is 25 minutes.</p>
